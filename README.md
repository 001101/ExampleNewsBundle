# Sulu ExampleNewsBundle Tutorial

This is a step-by-step tutorial how to create an extension for [Sulu](https://github.com/sulu-io/sulu). Each step is
explained as a pull request against the previous step and with additional information in a blog-post on
[blog.sulu.io](blog.sulu.io). It was built with the releases 1.1.* of Sulu.

## Documentation

The master contains the whole code to run the example. The code foreach step comes in a single branch that build on the previous
one. The first branch 00-symfony-bundle is a simple bundle-bootstrap which was generated by Symfony's `generate:bundle`
command.

The steps are explained as [pull requests](https://github.com/sulu-io/ExampleNewsBundle/pulls), each building upon the
previous branch and contains descriptions in form of comments and a link to the related blog-post.

## Installation
